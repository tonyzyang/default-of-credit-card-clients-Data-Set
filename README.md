**Domain Background**
 This data set was from Department of Information Management, Chung Hua University and Department of Civil Engineering, Tamkang University
 
 The dependent variable was real probability of defaul
the independent variables include 'LIMIT_BAL', 'SEX', 'EDUCATION', 'MARRIAGE', 'AGE', 'PAY_0','PAY_2', 'PAY_3', 'PAY_4', 'PAY_5', 'PAY_6', 'BILL_AMT1', 'BILL_AMT2' 'BILL_AMT3', 'BILL_AMT4', 'BILL_AMT5', 'BILL_AMT6', 'PAY_AMT1' 'PAY_AMT2', 'PAY_AMT3', 'PAY_AMT4', 'PAY_AMT5', 'PAY_AMT6', and 'default payment next month'. 


the paper related to this data set was : Yeh, I. C., & Lien, C. H. (2009). The comparisons of data mining techniques for the predictive accuracy of probability of default of credit card clients. Expert Systems with Applications, 36(2), 2473-2480.


**Problem Statement**

The problem was to analysis the customer default payments in Taiwan and compares the predictive accuracy of probability of default by using the indenpendent variables

**solutions Statement**
For the solutions, we can use the KNN classifer model to show how well the performance for the dataset

**Bench Mark** 
Bench Mark would be a Decision TREE


**Metrics**
F-score----is inbalance

**Algorithms and Techniques**
Using the data cleaning for analysing the data, delete the rows with the unknown SEX and MARRIAGE.
